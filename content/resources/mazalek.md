description: This thesis presents three storytelling systems for interactive point-of-
  view narratives using tangible interface technology. The focus is the design and
  development of computational story models and interfaces that enable users to experience
  new forms of interaction with stories in the digital medium. Specifically, I propose
  that having multiple tightly related character viewpoints can be used as a means
  of structuring comprehensive and coherent interactive story experiences. Furthermore,
  I also claim that by using tangible interfaces that are tightly integrated into
  the narrative model and story content, users can have rich interactive story experiences
  in which the interaction/interface does not distract from their engagement in the
  story.

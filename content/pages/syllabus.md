Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Experiences in Interactive Art
------------------------------

This class focuses on discussions on interactive art and its meaning. In weekly class sessions, visiting artists will discuss their own work from a theoretical and practical perspective with the class. Class discussions will center on questions of art and interactivity. Relevant topics include the purpose and language of art, creative practices, the appropriation of new technologies, social relevance, common artistic themes, and the response and involvement of audiences.

During the term students will be asked to develop, alone or in collaboration, an art work that can be exhibited in a gallery setting. Inspiration for this work might be drawn from class discussions with visiting artists or from prior personal work or interests. While not required, interactive art works are strongly encouraged. Student works are shown at an end of term exhibition at the CAVS that is open to the MIT community.

Her work has been presented in the United States, Europe and Canada as well as in print and on radio and television. Her current project "Spectropia", an interactive supernatural thriller about the infinite deferrals of desire, is a feature length interactive movie for two players that will be presented both as a DVD Internet product and as a full scale cinematic performance event for an audience. The DVD "Sally or the Bubble Burst" is a scene from the "Spectropia" project. Dove has received numerous grants and awards including support from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Greenwall Foundation, the Langlois Foundation, New York State Council on the Arts, National Endowment for the Arts, New York Foundation for the Arts, and the Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts from M.I.T.

### Ian Flitman

Ian Flitman was born in 1963 and grew up in a southern suburb of London. His continuing interest in the arts has led him through successive periods of first poetry, then theatre, followed by film. He made two 16mm films having been involved in all stages of their execution namely having written, produced, directed and edited them (_An Almost Selfish Film_ - 8 mins 1991, _One Across_ - 16 mins 1994). After seeing the computer generated _Toy Story,_ he decided to become involved in digital media. He studied Software Systems for the Arts and Media at the University of Hertfordshire (B.Sc. Hons., first) and won a RSA Student Design Award in Interactive Media sponsored by Macromedia in 1999. After teaching briefly on the degree he completed, Ian Flitman then went into the maelstrom of dotcoms. He produced work and campaigns for clients such as Coca-Cola, Philips, Channel 4 and the British government. In May 2002 he left London and moved to Istanbul, the story of which is documented in his online project "Hackney Girl". This project reflects his current interest in digital cinema and utilises his past experience in storytelling, film and computer media. Ian now teaches Contemporary Media and the History and Aesthetics of Animation at Bilgi University, Istanbul.

### Ali Mazalek

Ali Mazalek is a Ph.D. candidate in the Interactive Cinema group at the MIT Media Laboratory. Her research explores how digital stories can take on tangible forms and can engage audiences in sociable interactions with the narrative content and with each other. Her recent work includes the development of a tangible interaction platform called TViews that uses wireless graspable pawns on a sensing surface as a means of navigating through complex spatially structured and multi-threaded stories. The platform has been used in several participatory storytelling experiences with both young people and adults. Ali received a MS in Media Arts and Sciences from MIT and a B.Sc. in Computer Science, Mathematics and Film Studies from the University of Toronto.

### Krysztof Wodiczko

Born in Warsaw, Poland in 1943, Krzysztof Wodiczko lives and works in New York City and Boston, Massachusetts. He received a MFA from the Academy of Fine Arts (Akademia Sztuk Pieknych), Warsaw, Poland. Known for his twenty-five years of socially and politically charged public projections, Wodiczko explores the fundamentals of democracy in works designed for public space. Addressing such issues as homelessness, militarization, and xenophobia, Wodiczko uses public monuments, structures of symbolic power and collective memory, as integral foils for his iconic imagery. He has also developed a series of sculpture-instruments including, Homeless Vehicles, mobile shelters for homeless people and Mouthpieces and Alien Staffs, video-embedded objects through which individuals on the street can create and control their own representations. Wodiczko has presented public projections on the New York City Department of Public Affairs Building, Columbus Circle, New York City (1999); the Bunker Hill Monument, Boston, Massachusetts (1998); the Lenin Monument, Leninplatz, East Berlin (1990); the San Diego Museum of Man and Centro Cultural Tijuana (1998); the Guildhall, Derry, Northern Ireland (1985), and others. In addition to public projections and group exhibitions, Wodiczko presented three retrospective exhibitions in the 1990s, at Hiroshima City Art Museum, Japan (1999); De Appel Foundation, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (1995); and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota (1992).
